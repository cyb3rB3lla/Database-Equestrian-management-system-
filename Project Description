The system provides structured SQL queries that allow administrators to:

- Manage Horses

View full horse details including meal type and required needs

Filter horses based on meal count, gender, or feeding requirements

Calculate total daily meals for all horses
Manage Members

Retrieve members with specific first/last names

View all members along with their subscription type

Count the total number of members

Filter members by subscription type (1, 2, or 3)

- Manage Employees

Retrieve company owners

Fetch employees who have full names

Search employees whose names contain "Mohammad"

Count total employees

Identify oldest employees by ID

Filter employees based on working days or weekend schedule

- Database Entities Overview

The system uses relational tables such as:

Hourses

HourseMealTypes

These are linked through foreign keys such as MealType, HourseNeeded, and MemberType to generate complete joined results.
