This project is a SQL-based management system that handles multiple entities in a horse training or boarding center.
The system provides structured SQL queries that allow administrators to:

🐎 Manage Horses

Retrieve total number of horses

View full horse details including meal type and required needs

Filter horses based on meal count, gender, or feeding requirements

Calculate total daily meals for all horses
